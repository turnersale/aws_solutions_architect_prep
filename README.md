# AWS Solutions Architect Prep

## Purpose
This repo is a collection of my study notes and tools for the AWS Solutions Architect - Associate exam. The intent is to document the process and provide resources to anyone who finds this repo.

## Layout
This repo will contain a couple subdirectories, primary based on the type of file (for instance, whitepages). This readme does not contain links to all files, but the notes readme does contain a link to each file prior to the notes.
