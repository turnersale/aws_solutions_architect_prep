# AWS Solutions Architect Prep

## Purpose
This repo is a collection of my study notes and tools for the AWS Solutions Architect - Associate exam. The intent is to document the process and provide resources to anyone who finds this repo. I am more than happy to include notes and experiences of others, so feel free to do a pull request as you so fit as long as it matches up with the general setup.

## Layout
This repo will contain a subdirectory for each AWS service that has been analyzed. In addition there will be some high-level documentation (such as practice tests other documents) that will have their own locations as well.

There is also a note in this top level directory that is for defining terminology. It will be updated frequently and is a simple dictionary.

## Notes
Each set of notes must be linked here for speed. Notes must be in markdown and should be structured using bullets where possible. This is for ease of searching and to simplify note taking. Links to webpages are also encouraged as long as they are to reputable sources (such as AWS documentation, StackOverflow or testing companies).

## Services
This is a list of all services and their status (read, in progress or otherwise) but is by no means a comprehensive list of all AWS services. This list may also contain links to directories that are not services but other collections of information.
