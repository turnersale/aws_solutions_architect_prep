## Linux User Guide
[User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/concepts.html)

* What is Amazon EC2?
  * Elastic Compute Cloud provides scalable computing capacity
  * No hardware investment
  * Features of EC2
    * Virtual compute environments, known as instances
    * Preconfigured templates, known as Amazon Machine Images (AMIs), including OS and software
    * Secure login with key pairs
    * Temporary storage volumes, known as instance store volumes
    * Persistent storage volumes using Elastic Block Store (EBS)
    * Multiple physical locations, including regions and availability zones
    * Firewall and security groups
    * Static IPv4 addresses, known as elastic IP addresses
    * Metadata, known as tags
    * Virtual networks isolated fro the rest of AWS, known as Virtual Private Clouds (VPC)
  * Instances and AMIs
    * AMIs (Amazon Machine Instances) are templates that contain the OS and other software like servers
    * AMIs are used to launch instances across multiple machines
    * Instances are virtual servers
    * Instance types define the resources of the host (RAM, vCPUs, etc.) and multiple instance types can be launched from the same AMI
    * [Instance Types](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/) as of 11/05/20
    * AWS accounts have limits on the number of live instances, see [here](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/faqs/#how-many-instances-ec2)
    * Storage blocks are allocated upon launch but are deleted upon failure, hibernation, or termination
    * Security Best Practices
      * Use AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management)
      * Restrict access by allowing only trusted hosts or networks to access ports
      * Review the rules inside security groups and ensure the principle of least privilege (only open permissions based on requirements)
      * Consider a bastion security group that allows external logins and the rest inside a more secure group
      * Disable password based logins for instances, especially root
    * Stopping an instance performs a normal shutdown and retains the EBS attached volumes
    * Costs are not accrued while stopped, but each stop operation is charged at least one minute
    * Terminating instances deletes the root volumes and the instance, while retaining the EBS volumes
    * Termination can be disabled by instance
  * Regions and Zones
    * Regions are separate geographic areas
    * Availability Zones are multiple, isolated locations within a region
    * Local zones provide placement of resources closer to the end users
    * Outposts bring AWS services and infrastructure to other data centers, co-location space, or on-prem facilities
    * Wavelength zones allow deployment to low latency 5G devices and end users in edge locations on telecom carriers' networks\
    * Viewing resources only shows those that are available in the region you are working in and automatic replication is not the norm
    * There are costs for data transfer between regions
    * [Global infrastructure](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/)
    * Availability zones allow for you to select where to deploy resources or AWS can automate selection
    * Elastic IPs can be used to mask failure in a single AZ by mapping to another AZ
    * Outposts are AWS managed resources on-prem or in user defined locations and must be ordered based on the Outpost [catalog](http://aws.amazon.com/outposts/pricing/)
  * Root Device Volumes
    * You can choose to launch instances with EBS or instance stores
    * EBS is recommended as they launch faster and use persistent storage
    * EBS volumes allow for restarting instances without losing data, although the default is to delete when the instance is terminated
* Best Practices
  * Security
    * Manage instances using federation, IAM users and IAM roles
    * Establish credential management policies and procedures
    * Implement least permissive rules for security groups
    * Regularly patch and update OS and applications
  * Storage
    * Understand the root device types
    * Use separate EBS volumes for the OS and the data, ensuring that data persists after instance termination
    * Use instance stores to store temporary data
    * Encrypt EBS volumes and snapshots
  * Resource Management
    * Use instance metadata and custom resource taags to track and identify resources
    * View and request resource limits in advance
  * Backup and Recovery
    * Regularly backup EBS volumes using snapshots
    * Deploy critical components accross AZs and replicate appropriately
    * Design applications to handle dynamic IPs
    * Monitor and respond to [events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/monitoring_ec2.html)
    * Ensure you are ready for failover
      * You can use elastic network interfaces to replacement instances
      * You can also use EC2 Auto Scaling
    * Regularly test the recovery and failure process
  * Networking
    * Set the TTL (Time to Live) values to 255 for IPv4 or IPv6
* Amazon Machine Instances
  * Includes
    * One or more EBS snapshots or root templates
    * Launch permissions that control access
    * Block device mapping for volume attachment
  * AMI Types
    * Can be selected based on region, OS, architecture, launch permissions and root storage
    * Launch permissions
      * Public = owner grants permissions to all AWS accounts
      * explicit = owner grants access to certain accounts
      * implicit = the owner has implicit permissions
    * Developers can charge for their images per guidelines
    * Root device storage
      * EBS usually takes less than a minute to boot, sized up to 16 TiB, is deleted upon termination (but that can be altered), types can be altered and storage and snapshots are charged
      * Instance stores usually launch in under 5 minutes, 10GiB sized disks, is only persisted during instance life, type alterations are not available and only S3 for AMI storage is charged
  * Virtualization Types
    * PV = paravirtual
    * HVM = hardware virtual machine
    * Best performance can be found with current gen types and HVMs
    * HVM
      * Presents a fully virtualized set of hardware
      * Allows an OS to run directly without modifications
      * Can access hardware extensions like GPUs and networking
    * PV
      * Boot with PV-GRUB which starts the boot cycle then chain loads the kernel
      * Can be run on hardware without explicit support
      * Cannot access hardware extenstions
      * Not all AZ or Regions support this type
  * Shared AMIs
    * Guidelines
      * Update AMI tools
      * Disable password based remote logins
      * Disable local root access
      * Remove SSH host key pairs
      * Install public key creds
      * Disable sshd DNS
  * Paid AMIs
    * AWS Marketplace allows you to buy software for AWS including AMIs
    * Pricing and charges are set by the owner and charged on top of normal fees
  * Spot instances are only run on demand and on different hosts
  * Reserved instances are purchased for a period and reserves a host
  * Amazon Linux
    * Provided by AWS
    * Designed for stability, security and high performance
    * Includes packages for AWS integration
    * AWS provides ongoing security and maintenance
    * Most applications designed to run on CentOS run on Amazon Linux

      *  Graphs are also automatically generated in the AWS console and the CloudWatch console
      *  Alarms can be configured to send notifications when a metric reaches a defined threshold
      *  Alarms can also be used to trigger reboots, starts, stops and terminations on an instance basis
   *  EventBridge
      *  Can be used to receive near real-time metrics and trigger other services, such as:

         *  Notify an SNS topic when a new EC2 instance starts
   *  CloudTrail
      *  Provides records for all actions taken by a user, role, or AWS service in EC2
      *  Can enable continuous delivery to an S3 bucket for storage or view only the most recent events in the CloudTrail console
      *  Log file setups and configuration can be found [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/monitor-with-cloudtrail.html)
* Networking
  *  EC2 and VPC both support IPv4 and IPv6 protocols
  *  By default the IPv4 protocol is used and cannot be disabled
  *  Private IPs are not reachable over the internet, but can be used for communication inside the VPC
  *  Each instance is given an internal IP and a DNS host name
  *  You can provide an internal IP address if you choose, if not AWS will assign an IP from the subnet
  *  Each instance has a default network interface (eth0) that is assigned the IP
     *  The NIC and IP remain associated when an instance is stopped, started or hibernates
     *  Termination of the instance releases the IP
  *  External IPs can also be assigned and will receive an external DNS hostname
     *  The DNS hostname is resolved to the internal IP using NAT
  *  The default VPC provides public IPs by default, while subnets can be set to provide them or not
  *  Public IPs can be generated or removed during instance launch
  *  Public IPs are retained by AWS and are not associated to your AWS account
  *  Elastic IP addresses are public IPv4 addresses that can be allocated to your account and can be associated or removed from instances as required
     *  See more [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/elastic-ip-addresses-eip.html)
  *  Multiple private addresses can be assigned to an instance depending on the instance type and network adapters
     *  Useful for:
        *  Hosting multiple websites on a single server
        *  Network appliances such as firewalls or load balancers
        *  Redirect internal traffic to a standby instance (in case one instance fails)
  *  Bring Your Own IP (BYOIP)
     *  Available in all regions
     *  Assigned to AWS account and advertised online by default
     *  Must be registered with the Regional Internet Registry (RIR)
     *  See more [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-byoip.html)
  *  Elastic IPs
     *  Accessible over the internet and are assigned to your until your release it
     *  This is designed to provide a way to remap instances in an account without exposing the instance failure publicly
     *  If you assign the Elastic IP to the primary NIC then the previously assigned public IP is released back into the AWS pool
     *  There is a small hourly charge for retaining an Elastic IP if it is not assigned to an instance
     *  Detailed implementation notes [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/elastic-ip-addresses-eip.html)
  *  Elastic Network Interfaces
     *  Logical networking component that represents a virtual network card
     *  Each instance contains a default interface called the primary network interface
     *  If EFA is enabled then all network cards become available for the instance
  *
